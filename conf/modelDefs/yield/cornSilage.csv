; Fit of SSURGO representative CORN yields from the greater Dane county area
;
; Model Input Details
;	- Slopes: slopes above 25 (which corresponds to ~14 degrees) are not computed (result in NoData)
; 	- Soil Depth: Row crop roots can't exploit soil depths greater than 150cm so the max depth is  
;		clamped/limited to that value
;
; Model Output Details
; 	Results are bushels per acres, however the results are transformed in the (result-transform) step:
;		- and clamp to a sane output (0.2 to 25) MG/ha
;		- and lastly to tons/acre (x 0.44609)
