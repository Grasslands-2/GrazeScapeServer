; Fit of SSURGO representative CORN yields from the greater Dane county area
;
; Result is transformed to Corn silage as per: http://corn.agronomy.wisc.edu/AA/pdfs/A045.pdf
;  > The Relationship between Corn Grain Yield and Forage Yield, Joe Lauer
;
; Model Input Details
; 	- Soil Depth: Row crop roots can't exploit soil depths greater than 150cm so the max depth is  
;		clamped/limited to that value
;
; Model Output Details
; 	Results are bushels per acres, however the results are transformed in the (result-transform) step:
;		- quadratic transform from Corn Grain to Corn Silage
;		- and clamp to a sane output (0 to 25) MG/ha
;		- and lastly to tons/acre (x 0.44609)
