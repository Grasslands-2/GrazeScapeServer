; Fit of SSURGO representative yields from the greater Dane county area
; Slopes above 25 (which corresponds to ~14 degrees) are not computed
; Row crop roots can't exploit soil depths greater than 150cm
; The results are corrected for modern yields (x1.2), converted to MG/ha, and 
;	clamped to a sane output
