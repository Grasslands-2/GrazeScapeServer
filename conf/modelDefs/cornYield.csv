; Fit of SSURGO representative yields from the greater Dane county area
; Slopes above 25 (which corresponds to ~14 degrees) are not computed
; Row crop roots can't exploit soil depths greater than 150cm so the depth is clamped to that
; The results are corrected for modern yields (x1.3), converted to mg/ha (0.053), and 
;	clamped to a sane output
