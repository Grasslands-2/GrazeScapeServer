% The goal of the animal module (v1) is to convert kg-DM of various groups of feed
% to rough estimates of milk, meat, and manure
% For milk and meat, v1 of the module will just be assuming standard herd-level
% conversion factors based on Peters et al. (2014) - Table 3
% For manure, v1 of the module will be estimating manure (total, P, and N) using 
% animal numbers with WiDATCP equations and milk yield based on Nennich et al. (2005)

% FEED TO MILK AND MEAT
% First, we need to determine how much local feed has been produced for each of
% the following feed types: corn grain, corn silage, alfalfa, oat, non-alfalfa hay,
% and pasture. Note, these values are coming from the "Feed Bin" and will need to 
% be converted to kg-DM there.

Feed supply [kg-DM/year] = (Corn grain yield DM)+(Alfalfa yield DM)+
		(Oat yield DM)+(Non-alfalfa hay yield DM)+(Pasture yield DM)

% Next, we need to determine the feed demand per year for each operation type

% For dairy operations, v1 will just be assuming that milk is the only product
% Determine amount of milk produced per year based on daily milk yield and # of cows
(Total milk Production) = (Milk yield)*(Number of lactating cows)*365.25 % [kg/year]

% Next, convert milk production to feed demand based on Peters et al. 2014
(Feed demand for milk) = (Total milk Production)*(0.90) % [kg-DM/year]

% For beef operations, v1 will determine feed based on herd-level annual weight gain
(Total annual weight gain) = (Average daily gain)*(Herd size)*365.25 % [kg/year]

% Next, convert average daily weight gain to feed demand based on Peters et al. 2014
(Feed demand for beef) = (Total annual weight gain)*(14.30) % [kg-DM/year]

% Calculate feed deficit for combined dairy and beef
(Feed deficit) =
		(Feed demand for milk)+(Feed demand for beef)-(Feed supply) % [kg-DM/year]

% Assume that feed deficit is split between imported corn grain and soybean meal
(Corn grain imports DM) = (Feed deficit)*0.5 % [kg-DM/year]
(Soybean meal imports DM) = (Feed deficit)*0.5 % [kg-DM/year]



% FEED TO MANURE
% DAIRY - lactating cows (based on Nennich et al. 2005)
(Lactating cow manure) = 
		((Milk yield)*0.616+46.2)*(Number of lactating cows)*365.25 % [kg/year]
(Lactating cow manure P) =
		((Milk yield)*0.781+50.4)*(Number of lactating cows)*365.25/1000 % [kg/year]
(Days confined for lactating cows) = 
		(Confined time for lactating cows)*30.4 % [days/year]
(Lactating cow manure confined) =
		(Lactating cow manure)*(Days confined for lactating cows)/365.25 % [kg/year]
(Lactating cow manure P confined) =
		(Lactating cow manure P)*(Days confined for lactating cows)/365.25 % [kg/year]
(Grazed manure production lactating) =
		(Lactating cow manure)-(Lactating cow manure confined)
(Grazed manure P production lactating) =
		(Lactating cow manure P)-(Lactating cow manure P confined)
		
% DAIRY - calves, heifers, dry cows (based on WiDATCP)
(Dairy calf manure) = 17*0.453592*(Number of youngstock)*365.25 % [kg/year]
(Dairy calf manure P) = (Dairy calf manure)*(4/2000)*0.4364 % [kg/year] (4 lb/ton P2O5)
(Dairy heifer manure) = 65*0.453592*(Number of heifers)*365.25 % [kg/year]
(Dairy heifer manure P) = (Dairy heifer manure)*(4/2000)*0.4364 % [kg/year]
(Dry cow manure) = 98.5*0.453592*(Number of dry cows)*365.25 % [kg/year]
(Dry cow manure P) = (Dry cow manure)*(4/2000)*0.4364 % [kg/year]

(NonLact cow manure) =
		(Dairy calf manure)+(Dairy heifer manure)+(Dry cow manure) % [kg/year]
(NonLact cow manure P) =
		(Dairy calf manure P)+(Dairy heifer manure P)+(Dry cow manure P) % [kg/year]

(NonLact cow manure confined) =
		(NonLact cow manure)*(Days confined for nonLact cows)/365.25 % [kg/year]
(NonLact cow manure P confined) =
		(NonLact cow manure P)*(Days confined for nonLact cows)/365.25 % [kg/year]
(Grazed manure production nonLact) =
		(NonLact cow manure)-(NonLact cow manure confined)
(Grazed manure P production nonLact) =
		(NonLact cow manure P)-(NonLact cow manure P confined)
		
% BEEF
(Cow-calf manure) = 63*0.453592*(Beef cow herd size)*365.25 % [kg/year]

(Finishing manure P) = (Finishing manure)*(6/2000)*0.4364 % [kg/year]
(Beef manure) =
		(Cow-calf manure)+(Stocker manure)+(Finishing manure) % [kg/year]

(Beef manure P confined) =
